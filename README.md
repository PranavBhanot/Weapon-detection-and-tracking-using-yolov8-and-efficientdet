Abstract:
In today’s world security is of the utmost priority for everyone and is a huge challenge for security professionals to conduct continuous surveillance in a manner that is both quick and efficient. For this we need to devise a system that does not rely on human cognitive capabilities which has several limitations such as finite attention span, memory, fatigue and many more but rather takes inspiration from the human thinking and processing capabilities and replicate them in a computerized manner. The proposed system’s main objectives would be detecting the presence of a weapon/firearm, identifying the type of the firearm and tracking the movements of the attackers using those firearms in a CCTV or surveillance footage. To create such a system a custom dataset consisting of 10 classes of different kinds of weapons has been prepared with weapons such as daggers, battleaxe, rpg, assault rifles, pistols and revolvers with around 7500 images in total. Image augmentations like flipping, rotation, hue were performed to increase the training instances and achieving better results. The YOLOv8 model consists of a backbone, head and a tail. The YOLO model consists of a single shot detector (SSD) for classifying objects and forming bounding boxes. The main features of YOLOv8 include mosaic data augmentation, anchor-free detection, a C2f module, a decoupled head, and a modified loss function. EfficientDet achieves fair performance while using fewer resources compared to previous models like Faster R-CNN and is based on a compound scaling method that scales the model width, depth, and resolution simultaneously to improve efficiency. The YOLOv8 model after training gave a mAP score of 93.0.

The augmentations performed were horizontal and vertical flipping, zooming into images in the range of 0% to 20% and rotating images by 1 degree and 90 degree clockwise and counterclockwise, hue and brightness.
Annotating images for weapon detection with YOLOv8 involves the critical task of labelling weapons within your images to train your object detection model effectively. The process starts by defining the classes of weapons you want your model to detect, such as handguns, rifles, dagger etc.
